      "At the very heart of this world lay the capital of SS called Sharakhai. Some say that Sharakhai's ancient white walls are as old as the Great Waste itself. It is massive. This multi-leveled city is famous for it's sprawling towers and thick white shining walls. It houses the world’s most impressive libraries, towering aqueducts, hanging gardens, the Grand Bazaar, Silver Spear Academy and guild houses of every kind...\nIn the center of the city is the tower of the Second Sun and Second Moon. A massive spire that reaches up towards the heavens and protrudes out of the landscape. Atop this massive construct is a giant crystal which glows bright red/orange during the day and a tranquil blue to illuminate the sands at night. It can be seen from across the Shangazi. A beacon for Wind-Ships and lost travelers alike.",
