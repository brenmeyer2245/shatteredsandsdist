Under Feroze I was castrated & taught the arts of the hetairai, the expensive courtesan-slaves of Tuman; I was also hobbled, poisoned with wood spirit until I was blind. But my only friend from my childhood in Dumai, Ujarak the druid, had taught me the ways of the Moons and gave me my weapons of vengeance. By day a blinded whore, by night a vigilante bent on revenge against all slavers- this was the making of the Ghost of Tuman.",
